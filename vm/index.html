	    In this game, we are going to play one note to you.  The
	    objective of the player is to sing back the note in the
	    closest possible voice.  <br /><br /> There is a progress
	    bar with an arrow sign next to it indicating your
	    progress.  If you're singing in a lower pitch, the arrow
	    will point upwards, indicating that you should sing in a
	    higher pitch.  In case you are singing in a higher pitch,
	    the arrow will point downwards, indicating that you should
	    sing in a higher pitch.
