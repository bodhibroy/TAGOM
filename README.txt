This README is intended for deploying MOGAT on web servers.

Run the Makefile first to copy the files from the local directory to the server. Make necessary adjustments as deemed fit.

This project has been tested on Mozilla Firefox 15 and Google Chrome 21. This project should work on Firefox 4 and Google Chrome 10 onwards.  It should also work on Internet Explorer 8 and Apple Safari 5.0.6 onwards, but we do not assume responsibility for any problems during the game.  We recommend using Mozilla Firefox.
